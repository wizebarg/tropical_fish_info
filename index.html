            <h1>Troppical Fish Care</h1>
            <p>
                Keeping our pets is one of the most enjoying and challenging part of having a pet. Concerning about their health and how we keep them is part of our own strategies of caring them. In tropical fish, your knowledge and skills on how to keep them make determine
                their life span and health. It is a very tricky though each species of tropical fish have their own different way of keeping them. Each fish has their own specific placement of their tank considering <b>water’s temperature</b>,
                the <b>mode of feeding</b>, the <b>decoration</b> inside the tank, the <b>water filtration</b>, their <b>tank mates</b> and also the <b>location of the tank</b> indoor or out door. Many things we need to consider constantly to keep our
                pet including the prevention and curing of fish diseases like
                <b>white spot, red spot, fin rot, dropsy</b> and many more.

            <h1>Setting Up a Pond or Tank</h1>
            <p>
                Many average keepers love to put decorations on their tanks to make is beautiful. Mostly of this decorations are plastics and artificial stones, sands and many more. Decorations are good but there are many things need to avoid. Spiky decorations are not
                good for the fish. As they swim it might get scratched their sensitive body parts. Piled stone decoration can be dangerous if it falls. Small holes on decorations with slightly smaller than fish is also dangerous for them. They might look
                they can fit to the hole and in the end they get stuck. Choosing decorations which is a fish friendly is a good option in preparing home for the fish.

            <h1>Water Conditioning</h1>
            <p>
                Another things need to consider before buying a fish is water condition. Conditioning water in cheapest way is to sock the water for three days to one week under a moderate sunlight. From that days of stocking water, it help algae grow on the water and
                dissolving chlorine specially if the water is from the faucet. The thing that is strongly recommended is <b>do not put the fish on the water from the faucet directly</b> it kills your fish because the water from the faucet
                has chlorine. The chemicals from the water like chlorine is the one we need to avoid for the fish and that is the main reason why we are stocking them. Water in the well or in other sources could do so if there is no chemicals on it and
                be sure to stock them for how many days to be sure it is conditioned.

            <h1>Acclimating</h1>
            <p>
                When a fish is bought from some source, there could be changes of water and temperature upon transferring the fish. Changes of water and temperature could cause a water shock and stress to the fish. Acclimating is the solution of this problem. Acclimating
                is the process of adopting fish to its new climate or environment. The way of acclimating fish is to adopt temperature first by putting the cellophane/bag of the fish in the water and leave it floating for ten to thirty minutes in your
                tank of where the fish you want to place. After then open the cellophane/bag for ten to fifteen minutes. Lastly you can now put the fish in your tank slowly by hand or using net. It is recommended not to mix the water from the cellophane/bag
                to the tank for safety purposes. In that way, the water of the tank can avoid unwanted bacteria, algae or chemical from the cellophane that can affect to other fishes.

            <h1>Tank Mates</h1>
            <p>
                Buying a new fish to add on fish tank is to totally enjoying. Waking up in the morning and seeing fish getting bullied by others because of the new fish or the fish in the tank might feel the opposite. Fish keepers want to avoid such tragedy. To avoid
                this the fish keeper need to know what kind of fish they have and what kind of fish you want to add. There a are fish that we call “Territorial”. This fish is the one you need to avoid if you have a cute small fishes on your tank already.
                This territorial fish are commonly Ciclids. Ciclids fish like Oscar, Gourami, Convict, Parrot, Angel Fish and many more. This fishes chooses its territory before they became comfortable to their new environment. After they became comfortable
                they began attacking their tank mates that passes their territory or hunt smaller tank mates for their food. Aside Ciclids their are also fishes that is not territorial like Danio, Platty/Sword-tail, Rossy barb and many more. Another thing
                to be aware of is about the Goldfish and Koi fish, this fishes can be added to aquarium but their beauty are not for side view but top view. Fish like this is for ponds. The nature of their growth also for ponds because they prefer bigger
                home that they can swim freely on wide environment. Goldfish grows as big as coconut and Koi also grow as big as human child. This is the reason why it is recommended not to mix on smaller the tank with smaller fish. Another reason is
                this two fish destroys decorations that make your tank blurry and cloudy. Last thing you need to consider is the sizes of the fish. You may not notice it on the spot but as time passes some of the smaller one became the victim of the bigger
                one in the tank mates specially for Ciclids.

            <h1>Mode of Feeding</h1>
            <p>
                If you have fish on your tank, maintaining the water good and clear for the fish is crucial. Having a proper mode of feeding can help to maintain good water condition. If you are feeding fish, the best way is to estimate the food that can consume in a
                single meal. Most of the average fish keeper get addicted of feeding the fish because they enjoy seeing it, after then they live the food on the water floating if the fish are already full which is a bad habit of feeding. If there are
                food remaining unconsumed on the tank it can poison the water and later the fish will die. Keep in mind the importance of control feeding. Another good habit of feeding is to set an hour when to feed the fish and set on how many times
                to feed the fish in a day. For average fish keeper and starters, it is good to set once, twice or thrice a times you want to feed a fish. If you set it twice a day then maintain the same routine of feeding. Setting an hour is good too,
                if you want to feed at eight o’clock in the morning then keep the routine. Lastly is the location of where you feed the fish in your tank. I you used to feed the fish in the corner of you tank hen keep the routine. You will get enjoyed
                after each day you go to your tank, the fish will always wait on the location where you fed the fish together.
